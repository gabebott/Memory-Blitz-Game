# Memory-Blitz-Game

This is a simple memory game that includes elements of different types of code. I feel that this project pushed me as a beginning coder, and 
helped me to understand concepts that we have been working on throughout the semester. I am eager to hear feedback on this game. I enjoyed
making it, but it gave me plenty of headaches along the way. Below are my feelings on the levels of breadth and depth that I went into while
creating this game.

Intermediate level HTML: I feel that my project did not call for a lot of HTML work, but the for me as a beginer I still felt it to be a
good challenge for me.

Basic level CSS: The CSS was fairly simple cosmetic work on colors and sizes for the different elements of the game.

Advanced level JS: This is where the most headaches for me occured. I spent many hours researching functions and watching/reading different
proffesionals practices when building similar projects. This research ultimately helped me to leran a lot more and reach a level in my code
where I am pleased with the final result.

Intermediate-Advanced level Accessibility: I feel that this game is very accessible for people of all ages and that the design of it creates 
an engaging product for all. There is nothing extremely advanced in the design, but I think it does a good job of appealing toa large audience.

Thank you in advance for all of your thoughts, and I am looking forward to hearing from all of you!
